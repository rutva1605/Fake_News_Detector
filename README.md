# ðŸ§  Fake News Detection Using BERT Semantic Similarity

This project presents a robust approach to detecting fake news using BERT-based semantic similarity. Traditional models like TF-IDF and Count Vectorizer often fail to capture contextual meaning and word order, which are critical for understanding the true intent of a news article. By leveraging BERT embeddings, this system evaluates the semantic closeness between news headlines and their corresponding content to classify them as real or fake.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Fine-tuned BERT model for semantic similarity
- Preprocessing pipeline for news datasets
- Classification of news articles into "Real" or "Fake"
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The model was trained on a curated dataset containing labeled news articles. It includes both real and fake news samples sourced from publicly available repositories and competitions such as the [Fake News Challenge](https://www.fakenewschallenge.org/).
